# Architect

Design before implementing. Sketch types, function signatures, class shapes, and module boundaries with `not implemented` bodies and pseudocode. Synthesize across multiple perspectives, then fill in code against the chosen sketch. If implementation proves the sketch wrong, throw it out and redesign.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before starting.

1. Ground
2. Sketch
3. Agree
4. Implement
5. Scrap

## Phase A: Ground the problem

Build a real mental model of every system the new code touches. Run the **how** skill over the relevant subsystems.

Naming a file isn't grounding. Produce the traced model `how` prescribes. If the design redefines ownership or layering, also run the **why** skill on the existing shape so the rationale becomes a constraint, not a guess.

Skip Phase A only when the work is genuinely greenfield with no surrounding system to integrate.

## Phase B: Sketch

Run the **arena** skill with the design-sketch task and the Phase A grounding artifacts. Pass `references/runner-prompt.md` as each runner's prompt. Each candidate produces a design package shaped per `references/rationale-template.md`.

Design it twice. Require at least two structurally distinct candidates before synthesis, even when the first looks sufficient. This is the **exhaust-the-design-space** principle skill made concrete. Whole-shape alternatives, not point fixes inside one shape.

Screen every candidate against [`references/design-red-flags.md`](references/design-red-flags.md) before synthesis. Assume the next contributor is an agent that sees only the files it opened, copies the nearest example, and takes the shortest path that compiles. Prefer the design where a change that looks right from one file is right for the whole repo.

Compare viable candidates on interface depth. Prefer the design that hides more complexity behind a smaller, simpler public surface.

Arena returns one synthesized design package. The synthesis decision populates the rationale's "Synthesis decision" section.

## Phase C: Agree (opt-in)

Default: proceed directly to implementation with the synthesized design. No human checkpoint.

When the user asked for a design review first, present the synthesized package and wait for approval before Phase D.

## Phase D: Implement

Implement against the chosen sketch. Keep the public surface from the design unless implementation proves it wrong. Delegate mechanical filling-in to a worker when useful; the parent reviews the diff and owns the outcome.

## Phase E: Scrap

If implementation shows the sketch is wrong, stop patching around it. Redesign from Phase B with the new constraints surfaced by the failed implementation.
